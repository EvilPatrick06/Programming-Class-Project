# VS Code Extension Installation Timing Fix

## Problem Identified

The auto-sync task `bash .vscode/auto_sync_wrapper.sh` was running immediately when the folder opened (via `"runOn": "folderOpen"`), but **VS Code extensions were still installing** at that time. This caused conflicts and issues because:

1. **Extensions not ready** - The auto-sync script tried to run while extensions were still being installed/activated
2. **Resource conflicts** - Both extension installation and auto-sync competing for system resources
3. **Timing issues** - Auto-sync running before VS Code was fully initialized

## Root Cause

The original task configuration:
```json
"runOptions": {
    "runOn": "folderOpen"  // Starts immediately when folder opens
}
```

This triggers the moment VS Code opens the workspace, but extensions need time to:
- Download and install
- Activate and initialize
- Set up their processes and services

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added Initial Delay** ‚è±Ô∏è
```json
"command": "bash",
"args": [
    "-c",
    "sleep 30 && bash .vscode/auto_sync_wrapper.sh"  // Wait 30 seconds before starting
]
```

### 2. **Enhanced VS Code Readiness Detection** üîç
Created `check_vscode_ready.sh` script that checks:
- ‚úÖ VS Code CLI availability
- ‚úÖ VS Code server processes status
- ‚úÖ Extension installation activity
- ‚úÖ Recent extension logs
- ‚úÖ Node extension processes

### 3. **Improved Auto Sync Wrapper** üîÑ
Enhanced `auto_sync_wrapper.sh` to:
- Wait for container setup completion
- **NEW:** Wait for VS Code extensions to finish installing
- Provide better status feedback
- Use the dedicated readiness checker

### 4. **Background Operation** üîá
Changed task presentation to run quietly:
```json
"presentation": {
    "reveal": "silent",     // Don't show terminal automatically
    "focus": false,         // Don't steal focus
    "panel": "shared"       // Use shared panel
}
```

### 5. **Manual Override Options** üéõÔ∏è
Added new tasks for manual control:
- **"Check VS Code Readiness"** - See current VS Code status
- **"Manual Auto Sync (Visible)"** - Run auto-sync manually with full visibility

## How It Works Now

### Startup Sequence:
1. **VS Code opens** ‚Üí Extensions start installing
2. **Wait 30 seconds** ‚Üí Give VS Code time to initialize
3. **Check container setup** ‚Üí Wait for devcontainer completion
4. **Check VS Code readiness** ‚Üí Wait for extensions to finish
5. **Run auto-sync** ‚Üí Only when everything is ready

### Extension Readiness Checks:
- No active extension installation processes
- No recent "Installing extension" log entries
- Extension management processes completed
- VS Code server properly initialized

## Files Modified

### `.vscode/tasks.json`
- Added 30-second delay before auto-sync starts
- Changed presentation to run silently in background
- Added manual tasks for visibility and debugging

### `.vscode/auto_sync_wrapper.sh`
- Added `check_vscode_extensions()` function
- Added `wait_for_vscode_ready()` function  
- Enhanced status reporting
- Integrated with readiness checker

### `.vscode/check_vscode_ready.sh` (NEW)
- Comprehensive VS Code readiness assessment
- Detailed process and log checking
- Can be run manually for troubleshooting
- Returns exit codes for script integration

## Verification

You can now check VS Code readiness anytime:
```bash
bash .vscode/check_vscode_ready.sh
```

Current output shows:
- ‚úÖ VS Code CLI available
- ‚öôÔ∏è Node extension processes: 5 (still initializing)
- ‚è≥ VS Code is still INITIALIZING

## Benefits

‚úÖ **No more conflicts** - Auto-sync waits for extensions to finish  
‚úÖ **Better timing** - 30-second delay + readiness detection  
‚úÖ **Less intrusive** - Runs silently in background  
‚úÖ **Debugging tools** - Manual readiness checker and visible auto-sync option  
‚úÖ **Reliable operation** - Multiple layers of readiness detection  

## Usage

### Normal Operation (Automatic)
- Task runs automatically 30 seconds after folder opens
- Waits for extensions and container setup
- Runs silently in background

### Manual Operation
- **Ctrl+Shift+P** ‚Üí "Run Task" ‚Üí "Manual Auto Sync (Visible)"
- **Ctrl+Shift+P** ‚Üí "Run Task" ‚Üí "Check VS Code Readiness"

### Troubleshooting
If auto-sync still runs too early:
1. Check readiness: `bash .vscode/check_vscode_ready.sh`
2. Increase delay in tasks.json: `sleep 60` instead of `sleep 30`
3. Run manual auto-sync when ready

The fix ensures auto-sync only runs when VS Code is fully ready, preventing the conflicts you experienced.
